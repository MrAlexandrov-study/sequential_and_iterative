Iterative Layout Algorithm
Sizes: 4 5 5 6 
Initial layout cost: 65
Iteration 1: Swapped vertex 0 (component 1) with vertex 3 (component 3), new cost: 64
Iteration 1: Swapped vertex 3 (component 1) with vertex 8 (component 2), new cost: 61
Iteration 1: Swapped vertex 3 (component 1) with vertex 9 (component 2), new cost: 56
Iteration 2: Swapped vertex 11 (component 3) with vertex 14 (component 2), new cost: 55
Iteration 2: Swapped vertex 16 (component 2) with vertex 17 (component 3), new cost: 53
Reverting to original layout due to component size constraints.
